#ECARD.ly Blog

##WDI LA 7 & 8: Week 1 - Blog Lab
As part of an exercise during Week 1 of WDI LA 7-8, we were tasked to code the below design mockup for "ECARD.ly," a fictional ecard blog, using newly learned technologies including HTML5, CSS3, [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), and [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/). There are of course many different solutions to developing a site like this, but the following is how I chose to complete the exercise.
